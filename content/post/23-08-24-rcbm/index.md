We released a new preprint: "Relational Concept Based Models"!

**Abstract**
The design of interpretable deep learning models working in relational domains poses
an open challenge: interpretable deep learning methods,
such as Concept-Based Models (CBMs), are not designed to solve
relational problems, while relational models are not as interpretable as CBMs. 
To address this problem, we propose Relational Concept-Based Models, a family
of relational deep learning methods providing interpretable task predictions. 
Our experiments, ranging from image classification to link prediction in 
knowledge graphs, show that relational CBMs (i) match generalization performance of 
existing relational black-boxes (as opposed to non-relational CBMs), 
(ii) support the generation of quantified concept-based explanations, 
(iii) effectively respond to test-time interventions, and 
(iv) withstand demanding settings including out-of-distribution scenarios, 
limited training data regimes, and scarce concept supervisions.
